# brainF
There is a brainF interperter, where you can run any brainF program you want
There is a brainF game, which can get to be a bit of a challenge without any help
If you do need help in the game, I have a program here that converts certain symbols (all English letters, some punctuation, and the brainF symbols) to brainF code
